The *yw-reporter* Python script creates configurable reports from yWriter projects.

## Usage

The included installation script prompts you to create a shortcut on the desktop. 

You can either

- launch the program by double-clicking on the shortcut icon, or
- launch the program by dragging a yWriter project file and dropping it on the shortcut icon.

The report generator processes yw7 project files. If no yWriter project is specified by dragging and dropping on the program icon, the latest project selected is preset. You can change it with **Select File**.

The report options are set by ticking checkboxes. On program startup, the latest options selected are preset.

When the yWriter project is selected and the options are set, you can launch the report generator with **Create report**. A HTML report file is created in the yWriter project folder, and a web browser window opens to show it. If a report file already exists, you will be asked before it is overwritten.

If you wish to keep a report, you can save it under a different name from within the web browser.

You can generate as many reports with different options as you like without exiting the program in between. Note, however, that a new tab may be created in the web browser each time, so that you can also see earlier reports for which there is no longer a file.

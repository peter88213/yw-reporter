[yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. 

yWriter projects include a variety of metadata about chapters and scenes in addition to the actual novel text. To display this metadata clearly, yWriter can output different HTML reports. 

If the prefabricated reports are not enough for you, you can use the *yw-reporter* Python script to create configurable tables and display them in the web browser. This works with *.yw5*, *.yw6* and *.yw7* project files. 

The *yw-reporter* script has a graphical user interface. However, a Python 3 installation is required to run it.

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Python 3.4 or more recent will work.

## Download and install
